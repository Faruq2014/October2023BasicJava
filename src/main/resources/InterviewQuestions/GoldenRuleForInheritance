what is inheritance
	Inheritance is a process of acquiring of one class properties 
	normally methods and fields by another class. 
	It’s like a parent and child relationship.
	
	extends key words is use to build that relationship between two classes
	Child can use parent properties except private
	parent can not use child properties
	
	
	By default super constructor is invoke
	
	method over riding--->dynamic polymorphism
	    same method name and same mathod signature
	
	  child can over ride parent method except final properties
	    private properties can be over ridden
	    child can give same access modifer==same scope
	    child can give higher access modifer==increase the scope
	    child can not give lower access modifer==decrease the scope
	    child will always call overridden method by default
